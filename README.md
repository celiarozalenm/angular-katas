# Angular Katas 📝🥋🐱‍👤

6 Katas in which I practice the Angular essentials:
Components, classes, bindings, attributes, events, services, providers, directives (ngIf, ngFor), HttpClient requests, observables, and routing among others.

In each particular kata, you have a Readme file with its statement, here you have a direct link to each one:
