#Alarm ⏰

1. Create a new **component** *alert* with a button (start).
2. Create a **service** *alarm* with an **observable** that receives an estimated time in seconds and completes when that time finalizes.
3. Call the service *alarm* when the button is clicked and show an alert message when the alarm (time) ends.
4. Add an input field where you can define the duration of the alarm
5. Show an alert message if the time set is more than one minute.
